## Overview
### Description
Helping people put their health first by building exercise habits with proven habit building solutions.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Health / Productivity / Social
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile and have full range of use on a mobile platform. However we want for the app to eventually have a website version primarily meant for social browsing.
- **Story:** Facilitating exercise habits, planning, and finding accountability partners and a supportive community is the primary goal of the app.
- **Market:** This market is for adult individuals. While this app is suitable for fitness enthusiasts, it is primarily targeted at people reluctant to exercise.
- **Habit:** This app is meant to be used a couple times a week or daily based on the user's needs.
- **Scope:** The app would initially begin as a habit app with some light social features. We eventually would aim to become a social media website built to fill a niche need for wellness tracking and encouragement. Ideally aiming to work in conjunction with Apple Watch and have collaborations with wellness apps like Nike Run Club and Headspace.
